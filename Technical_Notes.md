# Methodological Justification

### Why Power Analysis?
I conducted a Power Analysis to ensure that our sample size was optimized to detect a meaningful impact without wasting public funds.

### Why Propensity Score Matching (PSM)?
Homeless individuals who join programs are often more motivated. PSM allows us to "twin" participants with non-participants based on demographic traits to ensure a fair comparison.

### Why Difference-in-Differences (DiD)?
To ensure that the income increase wasn't just due to Philadelphia's general economic growth, DiD filters out external time-related factors to find the program's true effect.
